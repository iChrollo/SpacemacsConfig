## Spacemacs Config

This is a conversion of all the good stuff from my [old and trusted emacs configuration](https://github.com/terhechte/emacs.d) to [Spacemacs](https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs). Spacemacs has the very same intentions as my original config, namely a beautiful merging of Vim and Emacs. However, Spacemacs is much better than anything I could have ever made. 

The Lisp is currently a bit unstructured, but I plan on creating it out of a babel file anyway (making this Readme, then, obsolete).

I'm currently using Emacs mostly for the following things:

- Clojure/ClojureScript
- Swift (Yes, Swift, because Xcode7 is currently very very unstable)
- HTML/Javascript/CSS
- Org Mode

### Features

- Half-Working Swift mode for org-mode babel. (see custom/ob-swift.el)
- Adapted for Mac OS X Keyboard
- OSX / Emacs movement keybindings (c-e, c-a, etc) in Evil Mode

Enjoy
